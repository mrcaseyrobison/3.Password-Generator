# 3.-Password-Generator
A random password web app developed with JavaScript.

+ Started by connecting JS doc to index.html via "getElemenetById"

+ Variable arrays on line 5 - 9 to build out the full set of characters available for the final password.

+ Variables on lines 12 - 16 provide parameters for if / else statements 

+ Prompt / Confirm within function "generatePassword"

+ Alerts created to return user to prompts if parameters not met

+ if statements function correctly within "var allCharacters" concat array (lines 53 - 73)

+ For Loop (Line 80) successfully randomizes alLCharacters array into "userPassword" variable container according to user choices.

+ Line 91 "return userPassword" ends code.
